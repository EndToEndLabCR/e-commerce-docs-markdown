**Options**:
- **50-100 products** (5-7 categories): Smaller, curated selection; faster to launch
- **200+ products** (10+ categories): More comprehensive, but delays launch
- **Phased approach**: Launch with 50-100, add 20-30 new products monthly

**Impact**: Medium - affects content creation workload and launch timeline
**Decision Needed By**: During Sprint 0
**Stakeholders**: Product Owner, Content Team, Operations
