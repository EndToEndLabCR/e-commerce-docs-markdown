## 🏛️ Architecture Principles

The project follows industry best practices and proven architectural patterns:

### Clean Architecture

Four-layer architecture ensuring separation of concerns and testability:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business entities (User, Product, Order, Cart), value objects (Money, Address, Email), domain services, and business rules. Technology-agnostic with zero external dependencies.
- **Application Layer**: Use cases (CreateOrder, ProcessPayment, AddToCart), application services, DTOs, and interfaces for external services. Orchestrates domain logic without UI or database concerns.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database implementations (SQLAlchemy models, repositories), external service integrations (Stripe, PayPal, email), caching (Redis), and framework-specific code.
- **Presentation Layer**: FastAPI endpoints, request/response models, authentication middleware, error handling, and API documentation. Converts between HTTP and application layer.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Strategic and tactical patterns for complex business logic:

- **Bounded Contexts**: UserManagement, ProductCatalog, ShoppingCart, OrderManagement, PaymentProcessing, ContentManagement (Blog), CustomerSupport
- **Entities & Aggregates**: User (aggregate root), Product (aggregate root), Order (aggregate root with OrderItem entities), Cart (aggregate root with CartItem entities)
- **Value Objects**: Money, Address, Email, PhoneNumber, ProductSpecification, Rating, Discount
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access with interfaces in domain layer, implementations in infrastructure
- **Domain Events**: UserRegistered, OrderPlaced, PaymentProcessed, ProductReviewed, CartAbandoned

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service, repository, and use case has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extend behavior through composition and interfaces
- **Liskov Substitution**: All implementations honor their interface contracts
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces (e.g., IProductRepository, IOrderRepository)
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions (interfaces), inject concrete implementations

### Additional Principles

- **KISS**: Simple, readable code over clever solutions; avoid premature optimization
- **DRY**: Centralize business rules and validation logic; use shared utilities
- **TDD**: Write tests first for domain and application layers; ensure behavior correctness
- **High Test Coverage**: Target 85%+ coverage in domain and application layers, 70%+ in infrastructure
